# Chattr: A simple live chat website

## Requirements

Requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file in the root folder.

You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Running the app

Simply use `docker-compose up` in order to run the app.

#### Notes

This app is not prepared to run in real environments. CI/CD is missing, test support is missing, user authentication is missing... you get the point. My only intention was to try out tools such as Django, GitHub, Docker, etc. I wanted to see how well I could get the hang of them and how much would it take me to make a functioning app.
